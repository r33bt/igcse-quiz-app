Perfect! Thank you for the directory structure - this gives me a great overview. I can see you have a well-organized Next.js project with some really interesting recent work (assessment-engine, mastery-calculator files from 8/23).

Let me ask for specific targeted information to avoid overwhelming the context window:

Key Architecture Questions:
1. Current Assessment System Status:
Can you show me the contents of these recent files to understand what's already built:

CopyGet-Content src\lib\assessment-engine.ts
Get-Content src\lib\mastery-calculator.ts
2. Database Schema Current State:
What's the current state of your IGCSE database integration? Can you run:

CopyGet-Content supabase\migrations\* | Select-String -Pattern "igcse"
3. Question Bank Analysis:
I need to understand your current question situation:

Copy# Show me the types definitions to understand question structure
Get-Content src\lib\types.ts

# And if you have a questions data file or sample
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include "*question*" | Select-Object Name, FullName
4. Component Architecture Status:
The QuizTopicSelector looks recent and important:

CopyGet-Content src\components\QuizTopicSelector.tsx | Select-Object -First 50
5. Current User Flow:
What's the main mathematics page currently doing?

CopyGet-Content src\app\mathematics\page.tsx
Specific Context Questions:
Recent Progress: Looking at the timestamps, it seems like you were actively working on assessment-engine and mastery-calculator on 8/23. What was the last thing you implemented or got stuck on?

Database Status: Have you successfully migrated to the IGCSE structure, or is that still in progress?

Question Mapping: Do you have questions linked to subtopics yet, or is that the major blocker?

User Testing: Is the /test-topics page working and what did it reveal?

Core vs Extended: Have you implemented the user choice between Core and Extended paths?

Start with those PowerShell commands and let me know what specific challenge you were facing when you decided to get me up to speed. That way I can focus on the exact problem rather than trying to understand everything at once!

Can you give me any SQL commands to run in Supabase in order for you to check all this, or any other PowerShell commands to check anything so that you can get a clear picture of everything? 
Perfect! Let me give you a comprehensive set of SQL commands to run in Supabase to get the full picture:

1. Check Current Progress Data Structure
Copy-- See all progress data for test user with subtopic details
SELECT 
  usp.subtopic_id,
  ist.subtopic_code,
  ist.title,
  usp.questions_attempted,
  usp.questions_correct,
  usp.easy_questions_attempted,
  usp.easy_questions_correct,
  usp.medium_questions_attempted,
  usp.medium_questions_correct,
  usp.hard_questions_attempted,
  usp.hard_questions_correct,
  usp.core_questions_attempted,
  usp.core_questions_correct,
  usp.mastery_percentage,
  usp.baseline_assessment_completed,
  usp.created_at,
  usp.updated_at
FROM user_subtopic_progress usp
JOIN igcse_subtopics ist ON usp.subtopic_id = ist.id
WHERE usp.user_id = 'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef'
ORDER BY ist.subtopic_code;
2. Check Question Bank Structure
Copy-- See questions available for subtopic 1.2 (Operations with numbers)
SELECT 
  q.id,
  ist.subtopic_code,
  ist.title,
  q.difficulty,
  q.difficulty_label,
  q.paper_type,
  q.is_baseline_question,
  q.question_text,
  q.created_at
FROM questions q
JOIN igcse_subtopics ist ON q.igcse_subtopic_id = ist.id
WHERE ist.subtopic_code = '1.2'
ORDER BY q.difficulty, q.paper_type;
3. Check Quiz Attempt History
Copy-- Look for any quiz attempt records
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%quiz%' OR table_name LIKE '%attempt%' OR table_name LIKE '%answer%' OR table_name LIKE '%session%');
4. Check All Tables in Your Database
Copy-- See what tables exist to understand data flow
SELECT 
  table_name,
  table_type
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
5. Check Data Timestamps
Copy-- When was this progress data created/updated?
SELECT 
  subtopic_id,
  questions_attempted,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN created_at = updated_at THEN 'Never updated (likely seed data)'
    ELSE 'Has been updated (possibly real activity)'
  END as data_status
FROM user_subtopic_progress 
WHERE user_id = 'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef'
ORDER BY created_at;
6. Validate Data Consistency
Copy-- Check if the totals add up correctly
SELECT 
  ist.subtopic_code,
  usp.questions_attempted,
  usp.questions_correct,
  (usp.easy_questions_attempted + usp.medium_questions_attempted + usp.hard_questions_attempted) as difficulty_total,
  (usp.easy_questions_correct + usp.medium_questions_correct + usp.hard_questions_correct) as difficulty_correct_total,
  usp.core_questions_attempted,
  usp.core_questions_correct,
  -- Check if totals match
  CASE 
    WHEN usp.questions_attempted = (usp.easy_questions_attempted + usp.medium_questions_attempted + usp.hard_questions_attempted) 
    THEN '✅ Consistent'
    ELSE '❌ Inconsistent totals'
  END as consistency_check
FROM user_subtopic_progress usp
JOIN igcse_subtopics ist ON usp.subtopic_id = ist.id
WHERE usp.user_id = 'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef'
AND usp.questions_attempted > 0
ORDER BY ist.subtopic_code;
7. Check for User Activity Logs
Copy-- Look for any user activity or audit tables
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%log%' OR table_name LIKE '%audit%' OR table_name LIKE '%activity%' OR table_name LIKE '%history%');
Please run these queries in order and paste the results back to me. This will tell us:

When the data was created (seed data vs real activity)
If there are actual quiz tables (indicating real quiz functionality)
Data consistency issues (do the numbers add up?)
What questions exist for the specific subtopic you're looking at
The complete data picture for proper debugging
Once I see these results, I'll be able to determine exactly how this progress data was generated and whether we need to fix the data or the calculation logic!
