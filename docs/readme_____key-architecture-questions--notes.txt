Perfect! Thank you for the directory structure - this gives me a great overview. I can see you have a well-organized Next.js project with some really interesting recent work (assessment-engine, mastery-calculator files from 8/23).

Let me ask for specific targeted information to avoid overwhelming the context window:

Key Architecture Questions:
1. Current Assessment System Status:
Can you show me the contents of these recent files to understand what's already built:

CopyGet-Content src\lib\assessment-engine.ts
Get-Content src\lib\mastery-calculator.ts
2. Database Schema Current State:
What's the current state of your IGCSE database integration? Can you run:

CopyGet-Content supabase\migrations\* | Select-String -Pattern "igcse"
3. Question Bank Analysis:
I need to understand your current question situation:

Copy# Show me the types definitions to understand question structure
Get-Content src\lib\types.ts

# And if you have a questions data file or sample
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include "*question*" | Select-Object Name, FullName
4. Component Architecture Status:
The QuizTopicSelector looks recent and important:

CopyGet-Content src\components\QuizTopicSelector.tsx | Select-Object -First 50
5. Current User Flow:
What's the main mathematics page currently doing?

CopyGet-Content src\app\mathematics\page.tsx
Specific Context Questions:
Recent Progress: Looking at the timestamps, it seems like you were actively working on assessment-engine and mastery-calculator on 8/23. What was the last thing you implemented or got stuck on?

Database Status: Have you successfully migrated to the IGCSE structure, or is that still in progress?

Question Mapping: Do you have questions linked to subtopics yet, or is that the major blocker?

User Testing: Is the /test-topics page working and what did it reveal?

Core vs Extended: Have you implemented the user choice between Core and Extended paths?

Start with those PowerShell commands and let me know what specific challenge you were facing when you decided to get me up to speed. That way I can focus on the exact problem rather than trying to understand everything at once!
